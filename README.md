### Usage
[![Lifecycle:Dormant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Dormant-ff7f2a)](<Redirect-URL>)

This repo is a place to store various scripts to analyse and visualise
telemetry data. It is currently a work in progress to enable
collaboration on scripting.

The scripts are currently stored by analysis theme

-   home\_range\_analysis (KDE)
-   data\_visualisation (animation, leaflet mapping)
-   movement\_analysis (mortality)

There are several other repos which include telemetry developed by the
ministry to support larger projects. These include
[clus](https://github.com/bcgov/clus) and
[sk\_tda](https://github.com/bcgov/sk_tda).
